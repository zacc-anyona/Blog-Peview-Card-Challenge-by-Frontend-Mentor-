## Overview
  This project is a beginner-level project for those who are starting their learning journey with CSS. Through this challenge, participants get to implement display properties to structure the content's of the web page in accordance to the design images provided.

  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
